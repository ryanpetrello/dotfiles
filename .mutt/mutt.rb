# Note: Mutt has a large number of non-upstream patches available for it,
# some of which conflict with each other. These patches are also not kept
# up-to-date when new versions of mutt (occasionally) come out.
# To reduce Homebrew's maintainence burden, new patches are not being
# accepted for this formula. Mutt power-users are encouraged to copy the
# formula and modify it locally, adding needed patches.
